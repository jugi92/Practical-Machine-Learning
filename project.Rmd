This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

summary(training)
training$classe

summary(testing)
cntr <- colnames(training)
cnte <- colnames(testing)

cntr[which(!cntr %in% cnte)]
cnte[which(!cnte %in% cntr)]

testing$problem_id

Remove the columns that are NA.

training <- training[,colSums(is.na(testing))<nrow(testing)]
testing <- testing[,colSums(is.na(testing))<nrow(testing)]

training[,"X"] <- NULL
training[,"user_name"] <- NULL
training[,"raw_timestamp_part_1"] <- NULL
training[,"raw_timestamp_part_2"] <- NULL
training[,"cvtd_timestamp"] <- NULL


testing[,"X"] <- NULL
testing[,"user_name"] <- NULL
testing[,"raw_timestamp_part_1"] <- NULL
testing[,"raw_timestamp_part_2"] <- NULL
testing[,"cvtd_timestamp"] <- NULL


library(caret)

library(doParallel)
cl <- makeCluster(2)
registerDoParallel(cl)

fitControl <- trainControl(## 10-fold CV
                           method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 10,
                           ## repeated ten times
                           repeats = 10)

tr <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rpart", trControl = fitControl)

Random Forest takes to long to compute.

trrf <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = fitControl)

tr

pr <- predict(tr, newdata = testing)

pr

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
